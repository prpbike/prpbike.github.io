        <p>We want to thank those that came before us and made our work possible. To the food banks that endeavored to feed their communities, long before Coronavirus arrived. To the founders and past organizers of the Disaster Relief Trials: your efforts pushed the envelope, and showed us what cargo bikes are capable of. To FamilyBike Seattle, for continuing to encourage folks to do lifeâ€™s daily essential tasks by bike. To groups like Cascade Bicycle Club and Seattle Neighborhood Greenways for advocating tirelessly for safe spaces to use a bicycle in the city and beyond. To all the bike shops that keep the local cycling community engaged and rolling. To Seattle Mutual Aid, for providing an example of effective community assistance in drastic times. Thank you all, and many others not named. We are just a small connective thread between others who have been doing good work far longer than us. Without their knowledge and previous efforts to build upon, this project would not be able to exist.
