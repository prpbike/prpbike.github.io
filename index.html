            <p>We are an all volunteer run group. Our mission is to further the use of the bicycle as a tool for social justice and combating food insecurity. To do this we develop opportunities that allow our volunteers get out on their bikes and become involved with the organizations and groups that are providing support to members of their communities that are most in need. These volunteer opportunities include delivering groceries for a food bank to families and individuals. They also include biking fresh produce that is donated by a p-patch garden or other urban farm to a local food bank. Plus itâ€™s just dang fun to ride your bike with a purpose!
