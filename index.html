        <p>Our mission is to engage in crisis response on a neighborhood level and to establish long-term community resiliency by creating or expanding Mutual Aid networks, all from the seat of a cargo-carrying bicycle. To do this we develop opportunities that allow our volunteers get out on their bikes and become involved with the organizations and groups that are providing support to members of their communities that are most in need. These volunteer opportunities include delivering groceries for four local food banks to families and individuals all over Seattle, rescuing food from local grocery stores for food banks, and also riding out to restock Little Free Pantries that provide neighborhood level emergency food support. They also include biking fresh produce that is donated by local community gardens to food banks and delivering school supplies to elementary students in underserved communities. Plus itâ€™s just dang fun to ride your bike with a purpose!</p>

        <h3>Safety</h3>
        <p class="whiteP">We are working to implement extra precautions for the safety of our riders and patrons due to COVID-19. These include requiring masks and gloves, and removing as many points of direct contact during deliveries.
