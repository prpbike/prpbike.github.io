        <p>This is Mike writing, one of the collaborators of what has been the Disaster Relief Trials Seattle. Everyone involved in this volunteer-run effort hopes this post finds you well, considering the world circumstances.<br>

Undoubtedly, we are living through a time of crisis. These circumstances demand action beyond just words -- and beyond simulating an abstract future disaster. It is time to put the principles of the Disaster Relief Trials to work. It is also a time to foster cooperation over competition and to expand our ideas of what community assistance can be. We must fold community care into our routine actions, instead of focusing on a single event.<br>

For these reasons, we have decided that the Disaster Relief Trials name no longer fits the work we are pursuing. We have decided to continue our work as the Seattle Pedaling Relief Project, to better represent the breadth of service we hope to provide. So far, we are using our bicycles for Mutual Aid deliveries, deliveries from food banks to homes, and putting more cargo capacity on our volunteersâ€™ bikes. <br>

For more information about our developing efforts, continue to follow along with our updates here on Instagram. As for the Disaster Relief Trials itself: We hope to resurrect the event in the future! However, until we can safely gather and ride together, that fun day will have to wait.<br>

We cannot control what crises affect our community. However, we can choose how to rebuild after they occur: for greater resilience to the next disaster and for a more just society overall. Our new mission is: To help those in need during times of crisis and to show all people the joy, power, and inclusivity of cargo cycling. <br>

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you volunteering with us soon.
